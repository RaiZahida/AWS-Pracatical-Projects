3. **Enable Static Website Hosting**
   - Go to the bucketâ€™s "Properties" tab.
   - Scroll down to "Static website hosting" and enable it.
   - Set "index document" (e.g., `index.html`) and "error document" (e.g., `error.html`).
   - Save changes.

4. **Set Bucket Policy for Public Access**
   - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
   - Add a bucket policy to allow public read access. Example:
     ```json
     {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
         {
           "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
           "Effect": "Allow",
           "Principal": "*",
           "Action": "s3:GetObject",
           "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-static-website-demo/*"
         }
       ]
     }
     ```
   - Replace `my-static-website-demo` with your bucket name.

5. **Access Your Website**
   - Copy the "Bucket website endpoint" URL.
   - Paste it into your browser to see your static website live!
   - ![Website Result](./images/website-result.png)

## Result
Your static site is now hosted on S3 and accessible via the provided endpoint.
